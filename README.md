# Chat_Box
Overall, creating a chatbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will require a combination of design and programming skills. With the right tools and knowledge, you can create a fully functional chatbox that allows users to communicate in real-time.
A chatbox is a user interface element that allows users to exchange text messages in real-time. In order to create a chatbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will need to use a combination of HTML to structure the elements of the chatbox, CSS to style those elements, and JavaScript to handle the functionality of sending and receiving messages.

Here are the basic steps to create a chatbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML structure: The basic structure of a chatbox will consist of a container element that holds the chat history and a form element that allows users to input and send messages. Within the container element, you can use div elements to represent each message bubble.

CSS styling: The CSS styling will determine the visual appearance of the chatbox, including the color scheme, font style, and layout. You can use CSS to style the container, message bubbles, and form elements to create a cohesive design.

JavaScript functionality: The JavaScript functionality will handle the logic of sending and receiving messages. This will involve using event listeners to detect when a message is submitted, and then appending the message to the chat history container. 
You can also use JavaScript to handle other features like displaying timestamps, indicating when a user is typing, or showing notifications for new messages.
